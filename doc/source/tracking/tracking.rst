Downloads
---------
Estimating usage of open-source software is a fundamentally difficult task, and "easy" metrics like number of downloads `have the potential to be misleading <https://blog.dask.org/2020/01/14/estimating-users>`_.

We are excited by the enthusiastic adoption of icepyx by the ICESat-2 data user community, and despite these limitations in data tracking metrics, we have begun (November 2020) to track user downloads and page views as shown below.

GitHub Traffic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Clones and views of the icepyx library directly on GitHub.
