    "### Get a list of available variables and choose the ones you want to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of icepyx for managing lists of available and wanted ICESat-2 data variables.\n",
    "The two use cases for variable management within your workflow are:\n",
    "1. During the data access process, whether that's via order and download (e.g. via NSIDC DAAC) or remote (e.g. via the cloud).\n",
    "2. When reading in data to a Python object (whether from local files or the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "A given ICESat-2 product may have over 200 variable + path combinations.\n",
    "icepyx includes a custom `Variables` module that is \"aware\" of the ATLAS sensor and how the ICESat-2 data products are stored.\n",
    "The module can be accessed independently, but is optimally used as a component of a `Query` object (Case 1) or `Read` object (Case 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates in detail how the `Variables` module behaves using a `Query` data access example.\n",
    "However, module usage is analogous through an icepyx ICESat-2 `Read` object.\n",
    "More detailed example workflows specifically for the [query](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_DAAC_DataAccess_Example.ipynb) and [read](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_Data_Read-in_Example.ipynb) tools within icepyx are available as separate Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "It can be confusing and cumbersome to comb through the 200+ variable and path combinations contained in ICESat-2 data products.\n",
    "The icepyx `Variables` module makes it easier for users to quickly find and extract the specific variables they would like to work with across multiple beams, keywords, and variables and provides reader-friendly formatting to browse variables.\n",
    "A future development goal for `icepyx` includes developing an interactive widget to further improve the user experience.\n",

    "The only required input to the `Variables` module is `vartype`.\n",

    "## Interacting with ICESat-2 Data Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Each variables instance (which is actually an associated Variables class object) contains two variable list attributes.\n",
    "One is the list of possible or available variables (`avail` attribute) and is unmutable, or unchangeable, as it is based on the input product specifications or files.\n",
    "The other is the list of variables you'd like to actually have (in your downloaded file or data object) from all the potential options (`wanted` attribute) and is updateable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, your `avail` list depends on your data source and whether you are accessing or reading data, while your `wanted` list may change for each analysis you are working on or depending on what variables you want to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables parameter has methods to:\n",
    "* get a list of all available variables, either available from the NSIDC or the file (`avail()` method).\n",
    "* append new variables to the wanted list (`append()` method).\n",
    "* remove variables from the wanted list (`remove()` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll showcase the use of all of these methods and attributes below using an `icepyx.Query` object.\n",
    "Usage is identical in the case of an `icepyx.Read` object.\n",
    "More detailed example workflows specifically for the [query](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_DAAC_DataAccess_Example.ipynb) and [read](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_Data_Read-in_Example.ipynb) tools within icepyx are available as separate Jupyter Notebooks.\n"
