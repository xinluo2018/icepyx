    "This notebook illustrates the use of icepyx for managing lists of available and wanted ICESat-2 data variables.\n",
    "The two use cases for variable management within your workflow are:\n",
    "1. During the data order and download (e.g. via NSIDC DAAC) and data access (e.g. via the cloud) process.\n",
    "2. When reading in data to a Python object (whether from local files or the cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "A given ICESat-2 product may have over 200 variable + path combinations.\n",
    "icepyx includes a custom `Variables` module that is \"aware\" of the ATLAS sensor and how the ICESat-2 data products are stored.\n",
    "The module can be accessed independently, but is optimally used as a component of a `Query` object (Case 1) or `Reader` object (Case 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates in detail how the `Variables` module behaves using a `Query` data access example.\n",
    "However, module usage is analogous through an icepyx ICESat-2 `Reader` object.\n",
    "More detailed example workflows specifically for the [query](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_DAAC_DataAccess_Example.ipynb) and [reader](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/blob/main/doc/examples/ICESat-2_Data_Read-in_Example.ipynb) components of icepyx are available as separate Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

    "Much like a directory-file system on a computer, each variable (file) has a unique path through the heirarchy (directories) within the file.\n",
    "Thus, some variables (e.g. `'latitude'`, `'longitude'`) have multiple paths (one for each of the six beams in most products).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be confusing and cumbersome to comb through the 200+ variable and path combinations.\n",
    "The icepyx `Variables` module makes it easier for users to quickly find and extract the specific variables they would like to work with across multiple beams, keywords, and variables and provides reader-friendly formatting to browse variables.\n",
    "A future development goal for `icepyx` includes developing an interactive widget to further improve the user experience.\n",
